            I provided skip to content link at the begin of the page. I used background image in the header section of the page. I provided heading level 1 to heading level 3 sequentially. I made flex boxes using CSS. I made a list how to push codes to github. I used screen reader how it reads the page. I zoomed in the page upto 400%. It is working good upto 200% zoom. Some contents are lost when page zoomed to 400%. So the page is not responsive. I need to work with that, how to make page responsive.
